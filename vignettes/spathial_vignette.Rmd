The spathial package contains function to create a path able to navigate a n-dimensional space. The package utilizes a number of R packages (but tries not to load them all at package start-up). Spathial loads packages as needed and assumes that they are installed.

Intall spathial using

```r
install.packages("spathial")
```

to ensure that all the needed spackages are installed.
